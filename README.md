to run this app you firstly need to clone this repository to your computer. Currently it is not possible to reach the messages page from the registration page or the login page. You can switch between the messages page and the login page, or between the login page and the registration page and vice versa. Also, right now it's not really possible to register or connect to the app, as we've only worked on the display at the moment. You can exit the chat page to the login page with the log out button. The transition between the registration page and the login page is made by the aqua colored link.
